        <p><b>RedLions</b> is the team name under the network of <b>Mr. Warren Trinidad</b>, a consistent top earner and an Emerald Executive of UNO International Corp. Sometime in 2010 when leaders under his network decided to come-up with one name that will distinguish his entire empire from the rest of the groups in UNO. Red has been the color of his group and lion symbolizes bravery and honor, the leaders of the team with Warren Trinidad decided to come-up with the team name "RedLions". It was a good timing as well when the movie Robinhood was unleashed in theaters in the same year and it caught Mr. Trinidad's attention to use the tag line "Rise and Rise again until lambs become lions."</p>

        but before he became successful, it was not that easy journey.
        <b>SUCCESS is <span style="color: red;">for those people</span> who are willing to pay the price.</b>

    <p>
        At the age of 14 his brother William died due to lack of financially support for hospitalization. He tried joining MLM at the age of 18 but nothing happened, at 19 he stopped from school, and by 20 he became a messenger, at 21 he became totally broke, at 22 tried another MLM yet nothing happened, at 23 he joined UNO
    </p>

    <p>
        One of his motivation why he joined UNO and studied network marketing really hard is because of his family, he promised to himself that he will do whatever it takes he will work hard to give his family a life of financial and time freedom.
    </p>

    <p>He became one of the members of an Elite team in UNO "ONE TEAM"sharing his life emotionally to his co‐distributors.</p>
       
       <div><img src="~/Content/Images/Home/Org/org_warren2.png" /></div>

    <p>A lot of people discouraged him to do the business, some of them are his friends, relatives and parents.</p>

    <p>There are times that he skipped his dinner and just wait for his downlines to go home, because he will just walk more than 6km. from the office to their house in Matina, Davao City just to save money.</p>

    <p>In the video below, his father showed his one and only pair of shoes, because he cannot afford to buy for a new one that time.</p>

    <p>But, he never gave up, he gave flyers everyday, prospecting everyday, and</p>

    <p><b style="color:red;">he never stopped no matter how hard it was, because he saw something in UNO and he believed that he can make it!!!</b></p>


    <p>
        He started earning not just an amount but BIG INCOME and he bought his
        BMW M3 Sport Series and Dodge Durango.

    <p>but another challenge came......</p>

    <p>during the Typhoon Ondoy....his BMW and Dodge Durango were drowned because of the flood, but he never gave up.</p>

    <p>He stood up and continued with his journey to reach for his dreams – to buy his dream house and lot, to travel in any parts of the world, and to make his parents happy. In fact he was able to buy a Ford Explorer car for his parents.</p>

    <p><b style="color:red;">For 6 years, he earned millions and helped a lot of downlines (people under his network) to earn as well. As of today, he continues to inspire a lot of people, that if we really want change, we can, if we believe and take actions to fulfil our dreams, UNO is one of the right vehicles for success.</b></p>
