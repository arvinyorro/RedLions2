<a name="history"><h3>History</h3></a>

<p><b>RedLions</b> is the team name under the network of <b>Mr. Warren Trinidad</b>, a consistent top earner and an Emerald Executive of UNO International Corp. Sometime in 2010 when leaders under his network decided to come-up with one name that will distinguish his entire empire from the rest of the groups in UNO. Red has been the color of his group and lion symbolizes bravery and honor, the leaders of the team with Warren Trinidad decided to come-up with the team name "RedLions". It was a good timing as well when the movie Robinhood was unleashed in theaters in the same year and it caught Mr. Trinidad's attention to use the tag line "Rise and Rise again until lambs become lions."</p>
